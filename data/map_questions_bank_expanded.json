      "options": [
        {
          "label": "A",
          "text": "The government should ban plastics because they are bad for nature."
        },
        {
          "label": "B",
          "text": "Policymakers should enact comprehensive legislation prohibiting single-use plastics, which contribute significantly to environmental degradation and marine ecosystem contamination."
        },
        {
          "label": "C",
          "text": "It would be great if the government could ban single-use plastics to help the environment."

          "text": "In my opinion, single-use plastics should definitely be banned by the government."
        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Scholarly writing uses precise agents ('policymakers'), formal verbs ('enact,' 'prohibiting'), specific consequences ('environmental degradation,' 'marine ecosystem contamination'), and avoids colloquialisms and first-person opinion."

      "explanation": "Ad hominem attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. Dismissing Senator Park's policy proposal based on her university background is irrelevant to the merits of her education reform plan."
