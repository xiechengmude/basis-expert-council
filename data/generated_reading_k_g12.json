The warming has accelerated the melting of Antarctic ice shelves, contributed to more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic, and triggered mass coral bleaching events across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. However, some researchers caution that natural climate cycles, such as El Nino, also played a significant role in the 2025 temperature spike.
